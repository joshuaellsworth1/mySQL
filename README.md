#Instructions:
This node application is connected to a mySQL workbench database that has logged information about different candies, their prices, how many total units, and how many units remaining. When node is run, the user will be prompted to choose an ID, each of the different candies is tied to an ID. Once an ID is picked, the user will be prompted again but will now choose how many of that ID they want. Once the user input is logged, that information is sent in and displays in the terminal. It displays the total number of bars, the name of the product name, the total quantity, and the price. Additionally, the application calculates the user input's number of candy bar's costs, as well as it logs the number of remaining units. In mySQL Workbench, the application will tell mySQL the information and it will display in the workbench. The application will again calculate the units left based on the user's choice of quantity.
